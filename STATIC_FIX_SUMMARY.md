# Static Noise Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem: Loud Static During Playback

The application was producing loud static noise instead of proper audio playback.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The static noise was caused by **multiple issues in the audio decoder implementation**:

### 1. **Incorrect Sample Format Conversion**
- FLAC decoder was directly casting `int32` samples to `uint16` without proper range conversion
- OGG decoder had improper float32 to int16 conversion
- No proper clamping to prevent audio overflow

### 2. **Improper Channel Handling**
- Incorrect assumptions about stereo/mono channel layout
- Poor channel interleaving in FLAC decoder
- Missing mono-to-stereo conversion for mono files

### 3. **Endianness and Bit Depth Issues**
- Incorrect byte ordering in sample conversion
- Wrong bit manipulation for 16-bit samples
- Buffer management problems

### 4. **No Error Handling Fallbacks**
- Decoder failures fell back to raw audio stream
- Raw streams caused static when not in expected format

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Completely Rewrote Audio Decoders** (`internal/audio/decoder.go`)

#### **MP3Decoder**
- ✅ Kept simple - `go-mp3` library already outputs correct format
- ✅ Proper 16-bit signed little endian stereo output
- ✅ No additional conversion needed

#### **FLACDecoder** 
- ✅ **NEW** `FLACReader` with proper buffering
- ✅ Correct `int32` to `int16` sample conversion
- ✅ Proper channel interleaving for stereo
- ✅ Mono-to-stereo duplication when needed
- ✅ Little endian byte ordering

#### **OGGDecoder**
- ✅ **NEW** `OGGReader` with proper buffering  
- ✅ Correct `float32` to `int16` conversion with clamping
- ✅ Prevents audio overflow with proper range limits
- ✅ Proper stereo channel handling
- ✅ Little endian byte ordering

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling** (`internal/audio/player.go`)
- ✅ Removed dangerous "raw stream" fallback that caused static
- ✅ Added MP3 decoder fallback for unknown/failed formats
- ✅ Proper error propagation instead of playing corrupted audio
- ✅ Enhanced debug logging for decoder troubleshooting

### 3. **Proper Format Standards**
All decoders now output audio in the exact format expected by Oto:
- ✅ **Sample Rate**: 44.1kHz (matches Oto context)
- ✅ **Channels**: 2 (stereo, mono converted to stereo)
- ✅ **Format**: 16-bit signed little endian
- ✅ **Proper PCM data**: No more garbled audio

## 🎵 Before vs After

### Before (Static Noise):
```
Raw audio stream → Oto Player = 🔊 LOUD STATIC!
Incorrect sample conversion → Wrong format = 🔊 NOISE!
Failed decoder → Raw bytes = 🔊 CRACKLING!
```

### After (Clean Audio):
```
Audio stream → Proper Decoder → Correct PCM → Clean Playback ✅
FLAC → FLACReader → 16-bit stereo PCM → 🎵 Music!
OGG → OGGReader → 16-bit stereo PCM → 🎵 Music!
MP3 → MP3Decoder → 16-bit stereo PCM → 🎵 Music!
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Build the fixed version:**
   ```bash
   go build -o bin/navitone cmd/navitone/main.go
   ```

2. **Test playback:**
   - Run: `./bin/navitone`
   - Add an album/artist to queue
   - Try playing - should now have clean audio instead of static

3. **Check debug output:**
   - Look for: `[AUDIO DEBUG] Successfully decoded [format] stream`
   - Should show proper format detection and decoding

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Key Changes:
- **Buffered decoding**: Proper chunk-based audio processing
- **Sample clamping**: Prevents overflow that causes distortion
- **Correct endianness**: Little endian byte ordering throughout
- **Channel management**: Proper stereo handling and mono conversion
- **Error boundaries**: No more dangerous fallbacks to raw audio

### Format Support:
- ✅ **MP3**: Native `go-mp3` support (unchanged, was working)
- ✅ **FLAC**: Fixed with proper `int32`→`int16` conversion
- ✅ **OGG Vorbis**: Fixed with proper `float32`→`int16` conversion  
- ✅ **WAV**: Simplified (assumes correct format)

The static noise issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
