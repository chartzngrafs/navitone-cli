### Concept

Navitone-CLI is going to be terminal-based Navidrome music player at it's base level. But there are some core tenants that should guide the project completely:
    * Graphical interface for a TUI
    * Keybindings and shortcuts that JUST MAKE SENSE and are user friendy
    * A help menu overlay that provide shortcuts and useful, concise info - it needs to be context aware
    * Mouse support - this is a tricky one, but important 

### Current Implementation Status

**âœ… COMPLETE - Audio System:**
- Multi-format audio playback (MP3, FLAC, OGG, WAV)
- Queue management with full controls
- Audio streaming from Navidrome servers
- Volume control and playback states
- Format detection and proper PCM conversion

**ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS - Interface System:**
- Basic TUI framework setup
- Navigation structure planning

**ðŸ“‹ TODO - Interface Sections:**
    
    * Albums
    * Album Artists
    * Tracks
    * Playlists

Sorting options should be available


### Stack

I'm open on this, whatever makes the most sense for this project.
