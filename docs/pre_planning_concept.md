### Concept

Navitone-CLI is going to be terminal-based Navidrome music player at it's base level. But there are some core tenants that should guide the project completely:
    * Graphical interface for a TUI
    * Keybindings and shortcuts that JUST MAKE SENSE and are user friendy
    * A help menu overlay that provide shortcuts and useful, concise info - it needs to be context aware
    * Mouse support - this is a tricky one, but important 

### Design

Think if you converted Feishin or Spotify to a TUI interface... needs to be untuitive and robust without being bloated. 

Sections:
    
    * Albums
    * Album Artists
    * Tracks
    * Playlists

Sorting options should be available


### Stack

I'm open on this, whatever makes the most sense for this project.
